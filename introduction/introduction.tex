\section{Introduction}
As the number and variety of communication services grow, so do the challenges of designing cost-effective networks that meet the requirements of emerging technologies in wireless, sensor, and mesh networks. Computer and Communication Networks is the first book to offer balanced coverage of all these topics using extensive case studies and examples.
This essential reference begins by providing a solid foundation in TCP/IP schemes, wireless networking, Internet applications, and network security. The author then delves into the field's analytical aspects and advanced networking protocols.
